I am a master’s student in the [Department of Library and Information Science](https://yslis.yonsei.ac.kr/doai/index.do) at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.do), studying under the supervision of Dr. Yongjun Zhu at [DataLab](https://datalab.yonsei.ac.kr/). In parallel, I am enrolled in a dual master’s degree program at [Simmons University](https://www.simmons.edu/), specializing in [Information Science and Technology](https://www.simmons.edu/graduate/academic-programs/graduate-and-certificate-programs/library-and-information-science-information-science-technology).

I primarily work in the areas of [science of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metascience), [mental health informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health_informatics), and [computational social science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science). Using methods from data science and computational analysis, I study large-scale datasets such as academic publications, bibliometric records, and social media content to explore how knowledge is produced, shared, and used in digital environments.
