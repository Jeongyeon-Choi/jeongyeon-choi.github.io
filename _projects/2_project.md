## 🎨 Project Overview

This project is a **digital collection and exhibit** created as the final project for LIS448 Digital Stewardship at Simmons University.  
We documented murals created by the **GN Crew**, a Boston-based graffiti and mural artist collective active for over 30 years.

The exhibit title, **“Boricua, Morena”** comes from a phrase used by rapper [Big Pun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Pun) to describe unity between African American and Latino communities in hip-hop. We felt this message of cultural collaboration strongly reflects the spirit of the GN Crew’s work in Boston.

## 🖼 Building the Digital Collection

We photographed GN Crew murals across Boston neighborhoods and created individual **digital items** for each artwork in Omeka.

For every item, we applied **consistent Dublin Core metadata fields**, including: 

- Title   
- Subject (using **LCSH** (Library of Congress Subject Headings))
- Description
- Creator
- Source
- Date
- Contributor
- Rights
- Relation
- Language
- Identifier 
- Coverage

Using consistent field description rules and controlled subject headings ensured better **searchability, consistency, and interoperability** across the collection. To help users experience the murals in context, we also mapped their **geographic locations**.

## 🧭 Exhibit Structure

The digital exhibit was designed with a clear, user-friendly structure.

It is organized into **two main sections**:

1. **GN Crew Members**
2. **GN Crew Collaborators**

Each section first presents an overview of murals, after which users can **navigate by individual artist**.

Every artist page follows a consistent layout:
- Artist photo  
- Short biography  
- Gallery of artworks  

Clicking an artwork leads to a detailed item page showing images and the full set of **Dublin Core metadata**.
